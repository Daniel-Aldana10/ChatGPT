# Enhanced ChatGPT Integration â€“ Backend Project

This project provides a robust integration with the ChatGPT (OpenAI) API using clean architectural patterns like Proxy, Chain of Responsibility, and Facade, making the system more reliable, modular, and maintainable.

---

##  Key Features

###  Intelligent ChatGPT Flow

- Structured POST requests to the /v1/chat/completions endpoint.
- Cleaned, validated input before reaching the AI.
- Simplified, extracted, and formatted responses to the client.

---

## ðŸ›  Design Patterns Used

### Improved Proxy

- Response caching with a configurable TTL (Time to Live).
- Detailed logging of:
  - API response times
  - Cache usage
  - Fallback behavior when OpenAI is unreachable
- Friendly fallback message in case of API failure.

---

### Chain of Responsibility

- Input is processed by sequential processors:
  - `ValidateInputProcessor`
  - `CleanInputProcessor`
  - `ImproveInputProcessor`
- Modular: Easily plug in more processors (e.g. for intent detection, spellcheck, etc.)

---

###  Facade (ChatGptFacade)

- Central entry point to the ChatGPT flow.
- Orchestrates input validation, AI call, and response handling.
- Manages exceptions gracefully.

---

###  Centralized Error Handling

- Blocks:
  - Empty inputs
  - Offensive language
  - Nonsense or junk text (e.g., "asdf", "lorem ipsum")
- Returns clear, user-friendly error messages
- Prevents backend crashes due to OpenAI/API issues
